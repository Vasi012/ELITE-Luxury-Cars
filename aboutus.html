        <h1>The History behind this website.</h1>
        <br>
        <pre id=p1>
            ELITE is a family run business having been founded in 2022 by Vasilica Catalin who today runs the business. 
            Vasilica Catalin is a student at Code Institute, and he learn HTML and CSS. 
            Using the skills learned until this point, he created this website.
            The success story of Vasilica Catalin is a fascinating one which began in the late 2016 when Vasi 
            started out as a Saturday and Sunday waiter at weeding events. By the age of 21 Vasi did not know what to do 
            and he was looking for challenges, founding the Code Institute he decided that now its the right time to do
            something for his life and change the course of it. 
        </pre>

            <pre id="p2">
            
                In 2022 at the time of creating this website, Vasi has spent no more than fifty hours trying to build this website 
                and offer to it the look that now it has.
                
                What is this website about?
                
                This website it is about cars, as we can see from the logo we are talking about ‘’Luxury Cars’’, the website 
                is introducing you to a variety of brands. 
                We can find a gallery section by clicking directly on the logo of any car sited in the first page of the website. 
                Moving forward to a carousel pictures with some of the latest brands arrived at ELITE.
                Above the footer we can locate the showroom, of course the website its a fiction so in the real 
                life we will not find one of this showroom. 
                </pre>
            <pre id="p3">
            
                The footer its offering us an easy access to all the pages related to the website also including 
                some external links for the social media platforms. In the right hand of the footer, we can see a
                program when this showroom works, behind this time, there are the hours spend everyday by myself 
                trying to build this website. 
                Moving forward to the contact us page we can observe a simple layout of how you can get in touch
                with the business directly via email or phone. Or some modalities to get to the fictive showroom
                such as flying, driving or using the subway. Moreover, by clicking on the ‘Book a test drive’ button
                we will be directed to a different page where we will be required to complete a form to book a best 
                time for us to drive one of this ‘beauties’.
                </pre>
            <pre id="p4">
                Therefore, please enjoy the time spend on my website. 
                If you have any suggestion you can send them directly to me on my GitHub profile 
                where I will be more then happy to consider your suggestion in the future projects that I will accomplish during this year 
                at Code Institute. </pre>
